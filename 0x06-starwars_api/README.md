Concepts and Tools Needed:
HTTP Requests in Node.js: You'll use the request module to make HTTP requests to the Star Wars API.
Working with APIs: Understanding RESTful APIs, fetching data, and parsing JSON responses.
Asynchronous Programming: Handling asynchronous operations using callbacks or promises (or async/await).
Command Line Arguments: Using process.argv to access command-line arguments passed to your Node.js script.
Array Manipulation and Iteration: Manipulating arrays to format and display character names.
Requirements:
Write a Node.js script (0-starwars_characters.js) that takes a Movie ID as a command-line argument and fetches character names from the Star Wars API.
Display each character name on a new line in the order provided by the API.
Use the request module for making HTTP requests.
Ensure your script is semistandard compliant and follows AirBnB style guidelines.
